DESCRIPTION
-----------
 
This distribution consists of a number of Source Filters.

For more details see the pod documentation embedded in the .pm files.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
 
Before you can build the Source Filters you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.002b1 patch f or better


BUILDING THE MODULES
--------------------
 
Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the modules
should be relatively straightforward.

The modules can now be built using this sequence of commands:
 
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
 
The filters have been successfully built and tested on the following
systems (at least):

	SunOS 4.1.3 (Sun C compiler)
	Solaris 2.3 (Sun C Compiler)
	irix 5.3	


INSTALLATION
