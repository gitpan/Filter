1.02 Tuesday 20th June 1995
----

    * First release.

1.03 Sunday 25th June 1995
----

    * Tidied up the build process so that it doesn't need an empty
      Filter.xs file.

1.04 Sunday 25th June 1995
----

    * The test harness now uses $^X to invoke Perl.


1.05 Monday 26th June 1995
----

   * updated MANIFEST

   * tee.t test 5 has been hard-wired to return true if run as root.

   * The test files don't use $^X to invoke perl any more. I've passed
     the MakeMaker symbol FULLPERL via an environment variable. A bit
     of a kludge, but it does work :-)

   * added a mytest target to allow users to play with the Filters
     without having to install them.

   * The EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN stuff has been wrapped in preprocessor code.

   * The hints files don't seem to be needed anymore.


1.06 Sunday 2nd July 1995
----

    * Renamed decrypt.test to decrypt.tst.

    * Renamed mytest.pl to mytest - it was getting installed.

    * exec.xs had a bit of debugging code lurking around. This meant
      that O_NONBLOCK was *always* being used to set non-blocking i/o.
      This has been removed.

    * Changed the way O_NONBLOCK/O_NDELAY was being detected. The Tk
      method is now used.

    * Addition of Filter::call - first go at implementation of perl filters.


1.07 Wednesday 29th November 1995
----

  * exec now uses the non-blocking IO constants from Configure. Thanks
    to Raphael for writing the dist module and to Andy for including it
    in Configure.
 
  * The decrypt filter has been enhanced to detect when it is
    executing as a dynamically linked module and if DEBUGGING is
    enabled. Thanks to Tim for providing the dynamic module test.
 
  * Tim provided a pile of bug fixes for decrypt.xs
 
  * Filter::call has been renamed Filter::Util::Call and the logic for
    installing it has been changed. 
 
  * The workings of the filter method in Filter::Util::Call has been
    changed.
